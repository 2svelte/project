Disaster,Event,Begin Date,End Date,Deaths,CPI-Adjusted Estimated Cost (In Billions),Summary
Flood,Louisiana Flooding and Central Severe Weather May 2021,5/15/2021,5/19/2021,5,90.00,"Torrential rainfall from thunderstorms across coastal Texas and Louisiana caused widespread flooding and resulted in hundreds of water rescues. Baton Rouge and Lake Charles experienced flood damage to thousands of homes, vehicles and businesses, as more than 12 inches of rain fell. Lake Charles also continues to recover from the widespread damage caused by Hurricanes Laura and Delta less than 9 months before this flood event."
Wildfire,"Western Wildfires - California, Oregon, Washington Firestorms Fall 2020",8/1/2020,12/30/2020,46,77.40,"A record-breaking U.S. wildfire season burned more than 10.2 million acres. California more than doubled its previous annual record for area burned (last set in 2018) with over 4.1 million acres. Five of the top six largest wildfires on record in California (dating to 1932) burned during August and September. The August Complex was the largest California wildfire, which began as 37 separate wildfires within the Mendocino National Forest, set off after storms caused >10,000 lightning strikes across Northern California. Approximately 10,500 structures were damaged or destroyed across California. Oregon also had historic levels of wildfire damage, as over 2,000 structures burned. These wildfires spread rapidly and destroyed several small towns in California, Oregon and Washington. Colorado also had a severe wildfire season, as its three largest wildfires on record burned during 2020. Dense wildfire smoke also produced hazardous air quality that affected millions of people that also included major cities for weeks. Hundreds of additional wildfires also burned across other Western states."
Severe Weather,Central and Eastern Severe Weather May 2020,5/3/2020,5/5/2020,2,52.70,"Severe weather across several Central and Eastern states including Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee and South Carolina. High wind and hail damage was notably clustered across southern Missouri and western to central Tennessee, which were the states with the highest damage totals for the event."
Wildfire,California and Alaska Wildfires Summer-Fall 2019,6/1/2019,11/30/2019,3,46.60,"California experienced a damaging wildfire season in 2019, largely resulting from the Kincade and Saddle Ridge wildfires. In addition, a key California electrical utility provider turned off power to millions of homes and businesses several times during days with forecasted high winds and extremely dry conditions. This step was designed to minimize wildfires, with some success, but it also caused billions of dollars in losses to those affected. Alaska also suffered a near-historic wildfire season with more than 2.5 million acres burned. These wildfire conditions were primed due to Alaska's record-breaking heat and dry conditions during the summer months. July 2019 was the warmest month ever recorded in Alaska."
Hurricane,Hurricane Michael October 2018,10/10/2018,10/11/2018,49,39.60,"Powerful category 5 hurricane made landfall at Mexico Beach, Florida with devastating winds of 160 mph and storm surge in excess of 15 feet. Mexico Beach was nearly destroyed, while Panama City suffered extensive damage. Florida's Tyndall Air Force Base also suffered a direct strike from Michael's most intense eye wall winds causing billions in damage costs. Michael's intense winds also reached well inland causing billions in damage costs to agriculture and forestry, as high winds hit during harvest season for numerous crops across several states. Michael is the third category 4 or higher storm to make landfall in the U.S. since 2017. Michael is the first category 5 to strike the U.S. mainland since Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and is only the fourth on record. The others are the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969). Michael was initially rated as a category 4 with 155 winds but upgraded to a category 5 with 160 mph winds upon further analysis."
