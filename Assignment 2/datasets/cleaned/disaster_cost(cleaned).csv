Disaster,Event,Begin Date,End Date,Deaths,CPI-Adjusted Estimated Cost (In Billions),Summary
Hurricane,Hurricane Zeta October 2020,10/28/2020,10/29/2020,6,125,"Hurricane Zeta was a category 2 hurricane that made landfall at Cocodrie, Louisiana with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph on October 28th. Zeta's path inland saw an acceleration of its quick landfall speed to nearly 40 mph, which allowed the wind fields to maintain some strength. These wind impacts propagated well inland affecting parts of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, northern Georgia and into the Carolinas. Hurricane Zeta was the fifth tropical cyclone to make landfall in Louisiana during 2020 as part of a historically active Atlantic hurricane season."
Hurricane,Hurricane Delta October 2020,10/9/2020,10/11/2020,5,125,"Hurricane Delta was a category 2 hurricane that made landfall near Creole, Louisiana with winds of 100 mph on October 9. This was nearly the same location in which category 4 Hurricane Laura made landfall 6 weeks prior. Heavy rainfall, high winds, storm surge, and nearly one dozen EF-0 or EF-1 tornadoes caused damage across several states including Louisiana, eastern Texas, Mississippi and Georgia."
Hurricane,Hurricane Sally September 2020,9/15/2020,9/17/2020,5,90,"Hurricane Sally was a category 2 hurricane at landfall in Gulf Shores, Alabama. Wind gusts up to 100 mph and 20-30 inches of rainfall caused considerable flood and wind damage across Alabama, the Florida panhandle and into Georgia. Many homes and businesses in downtown Pensacola, FL were impacted from flooding produced by storm surge and heavy rainfall. 2020 is now the fourth consecutive year (2017-2020) that the U.S. has been impacted by a slow moving tropical cyclone that produced extreme rainfall and damaging floods - Harvey, Florence, Imelda and Sally."
Hurricane,Hurricane Laura August 2020,8/27/2020,8/28/2020,42,77.4,"Hurricane Laura was a powerful category 4 that made landfall at Cameron Parish, in southwestern Louisiana on August 27. Winds up to 150 mph and storm surge in excess of 15 feet caused heavy damage along the coast and inland to the city of Lake Charles. Many broken water systems and a severely damaged electrical grid in southern Louisiana will slow the recovery process. Laura was the strongest hurricane (by maximum sustained windspeed at landfall) to hit Louisiana since the 1856 Last Island hurricane. Laura also had highest landfall wind speed to impact the U.S. since Hurricane Michael in 2018. There were additional impacts to surrounding states including Texas, Mississippi and Arkansas."
Hurricane,Hurricane Isaias August 2020,8/3/2020,8/4/2020,16,50,"Hurricane Isaias made landfall in southeastern North Carolina as a category 1 storm. Isaias accelerated up the East Coast, resulting in widespread damage and power outages across New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. There was also considerable inland flooding most notably in Pennsylvania. In addition, 34 tornadoes developed across North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey due to Isaias. Many tornadoes were weaker (EF-0 and EF-1) producing scattered damage to agriculture, structures and residences. Isaias also produced several EF-2 tornadoes and one EF-3 tornado that caused damage in coastal North Carolina and Virginia."
Hurricane,Hurricane Hanna July 2020,7/25/2020,7/26/2020,0,38.4,"Category 1 Hurricane Hanna made landfall at Padre Island, Texas on July 25 with sustained winds of 90 miles per hour. The impacts from wind, wave action and flooding were most notable in damaging coastal infrastructure and to the agriculture sector. The crop damage was most focused across the Rio Grande Valley in southern Texas."
Hurricane,Hurricane Dorian September 2019,8/28/2019,9/6/2019,10,34.7,"Category 1 hurricane makes landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, after devastating the northern Bahama Islands as a historically-powerful and slow-moving hurricane. Dorian tracked offshore parallel to the Florida, Georgia and South Carolina coastline before making a North Carolina landfall, bringing a destructive sound-side surge that inundated many coastal properties and isolated residents who did not evacuate. Significant flood, severe storm, and tornado damage to many homes and businesses occurred on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Dorian's intensification to a category 5 storm marks the fourth consecutive year, in which a maximum category 5 storm developed in the Atlantic basin - a new record. Dorian also tied the record for maximum sustained wind speed for a landfalling hurricane (185 mph) in the Atlantic, a record shared with the historic 1935 Labor Day Hurricane."
Hurricane,Hurricane Michael October 2018,10/10/2018,10/11/2018,49,29.7,"Powerful category 5 hurricane made landfall at Mexico Beach, Florida with devastating winds of 160 mph and storm surge in excess of 15 feet. Mexico Beach was nearly destroyed, while Panama City suffered extensive damage. Florida's Tyndall Air Force Base also suffered a direct strike from Michael's most intense eye wall winds causing billions in damage costs. Michael's intense winds also reached well inland causing billions in damage costs to agriculture and forestry, as high winds hit during harvest season for numerous crops across several states. Michael is the third category 4 or higher storm to make landfall in the U.S. since 2017. Michael is the first category 5 to strike the U.S. mainland since Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and is only the fourth on record. The others are the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969). Michael was initially rated as a category 4 with 155 winds but upgraded to a category 5 with 160 mph winds upon further analysis."
Hurricane,Hurricane Florence September 2018,9/13/2018,9/16/2018,53,25,"Hurricane Florence was a large and very slow moving hurricane that produced extreme rainfall across eastern North Carolina (up to 35.93"") and South Carolina (up to 23.81""), as prodigious amounts of rainfall were common in many locations. Florence made landfall as a category 1, at Wrightsville Beach, NC with damaging storm surge up to 10 feet and wind gusts reported over 100 mph. However, the majority of the damage caused by Florence was due to the rainfall inland, which caused many rivers to surpass previous record flood heights. U.S. Marine base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina suffered extensive damage that will cost billions to repair. The total damage from Florence in North Carolina is more than the cost experienced during Hurricane Matthew (2016) and Hurricane Floyd (1999) combined."
Hurricane,Hurricane Maria September 2017,9/19/2017,9/21/2017,2981,24,"Category 4 hurricane made landfall in southeast Puerto Rico after striking the U.S. Virgin Island of St. Croix. Maria's high winds caused widespread devastation to Puerto Rico's transportation, agriculture, communication and energy infrastructure. Extreme rainfall up to 37 inches caused widespread flooding and mudslides across the island. The interruption to commerce and standard living conditions will be sustained for a long period, as much of Puerto Rico's infrastructure is rebuilt. Maria tied Hurricane Wilma (2005) for the most rapid intensification, strengthening from tropical depression to a category 5 storm in 54 hours. Maria's landfall at Category 4 strength gives the U.S. a record three Category 4+ landfalls this year (Maria, Harvey, and Irma). Maria was one of the deadliest storms to impact the U.S., with numerous indirect deaths in the wake of the storm's devastation."
Flood,Louisiana Flooding and Central Severe Weather May 2021,5/15/2021,5/19/2021,5,10.7,"Torrential rainfall from thunderstorms across coastal Texas and Louisiana caused widespread flooding and resulted in hundreds of water rescues. Baton Rouge and Lake Charles experienced flood damage to thousands of homes, vehicles and businesses, as more than 12 inches of rain fell. Lake Charles also continues to recover from the widespread damage caused by Hurricanes Laura and Delta less than 9 months before this flood event."
Flood,California Flooding and Severe Weather January 2021,1/24/2021,1/29/2021,2,10,"California was impacted by an atmospheric river in late-January, in which more than 7 inches of rain fell from southern California to the central California coast. Rainfall totals exceeded 15 inches in Monterey and San Luis Obispo counties. These heavy rains caused flooding and mudslides in some of the same areas burned by wildfires in late-2020. This combination caused dozens of slides and debris flows damaging homes, vehicles and businesses and infrastructure. Highway 1 south of Big Sur was washed out while the Sierra Nevada range received several feet of snow, closing major highways. In addition to significant rain and snow, high winds also caused extensive power outages across parts the region."
Flood,Southeast Tornadoes and Northern Storms and Flooding January 2020,1/10/2020,1/12/2020,10,7.9,"More than 80 tornadoes and severe storms caused damage across many southeastern states (AL, AR, GA, IL, IN, KY, LA, MS, MO, NC, OH, SC, TN, TX, VA, WI). Storms and severe flooding also impacted northern states including Michigan, Wisconsin and New York. Significant damage occurred along the shoreline of Lake Michigan to roads, the foundation of homes and to Port Milwaukee. These powerful waves were generated by high winds and a lack of seasonal ice cover."
Flood,"Mississippi River, Midwest and Southern Flooding July 2019",3/15/2019,7/31/2019,4,6.2,"Additional major flooding impacted many Southern Plains states significantly affecting agriculture, roads, bridges, levees, dams and other assets across many cities and towns. The states most affected were Oklahoma, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Kansas, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana. Very high water levels also disrupted barge traffic along the Mississippi River, which negatively impacted a variety of dependent industries. Indiana and Ohio were also affected by persistent heavy rainfall that flooded farmland, which prevented and reduced crop planting by millions of acres."
Flood,Arkansas River Flooding June 2019,5/20/2019,6/14/2019,5,6.2,"Historic flooding impacts the Arkansas River Basin with damage to homes, agriculture, roads, bridges and levees focused across eastern Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Thousands of homes, cars and businesses were flooded due a combination of high rivers, levee failure and persistently heavy rainfall from May 20 through June."
Flood,Missouri River and North Central Flooding March 2019,3/14/2019,3/31/2019,3,4.7,"Historic Midwest flooding inundated millions of acres of agriculture, numerous cities and towns, and caused widespread damage to roads, bridges, levees, and dams. The states most affected were Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, South Dakota, Minnesota, North Dakota, Wisconsin and Michigan. This flood was triggered by a powerful storm with heavy precipitation that intensified snow melt and flooding. Of note, the Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska was also severely flooded - the third U.S. military base to be damaged by a billion-dollar disaster event over a 6-month period (Sept 2018-Feb 2019). This historic flooding was one of the costliest U.S. inland flooding events on record."
Flood,Missouri and Arkansas Flooding and Central Severe Weather May 2017,4/25/2017,5/7/2017,20,4.4,"A period of heavy rainfall up to 15 inches over a multi-state region in the Midwest caused historic levels of flooding along many rivers. The flooding was most severe in Missouri, Arkansas and southern Illinois where levees were breached and towns were flooded. There was widespread damage to homes, businesses, infrastructure and agriculture. Severe storms also caused additional impacts during the flooding event across a number of central and southern states."
Flood,California Flooding February 2017,2/8/2017,2/22/2017,5,4.3,"Heavy, persistent rainfall across northern and central California created substantial property and infrastructure damage from flooding, landslides and erosion. Notable impacts include severe damage to the Oroville Dam spillway, which caused a multi-day evacuation of 188,000 residents downstream. Excessive rainfall also caused flood damage in the city of San Jose, as Coyote Creek overflowed its banks and inundated neighborhoods forcing 14,000 residents to evacuate."
Flood,Louisiana FloodingAugust 2016,8/12/2016,8/15/2016,13,4.2,"A historic flood devastated a large area of southern Louisiana resulting from 20 to 30 inches of rainfall over several days. Watson, Louisiana received an astounding 31.39 inches of rain from the storm. Two-day rainfall totals in the hardest hit areas have a 0.2% chance of occurring in any given year: a 1 in 500 year event. More than 30,000 people were rescued from the floodwaters that damaged or destroyed over 50,000 homes, 100,000 vehicles and 20,000 businesses. This is the most damaging U.S. flood event since Superstorm Sandy impacted the Northeast in 2012."
Flood,West Virginia Flooding and Ohio Valley TornadoesJune 2016,6/22/2016,6/24/2016,23,4.1,"Torrential rainfall caused destructive flooding through many West Virginia towns, damaging thousands of homes and businesses and causing considerable loss of life. Over 1,500 roads and bridges were damaged or destroyed making the impact on infrastructure comparable to the historic 2013 Colorado flood.

Storm,"Northwest, Central, Eastern Winter Storm and Cold Wave February 2021",2/10/2021,2/19/2021,172,24,"Historic cold wave and winter storm impacts many northwest, central and eastern states. Temperature departures exceeding 40.0 degrees F (22.2 degrees C) below normal occurred from Nebraska southward to Texas. The prolonged arctic air caused widespread power outages in Texas, as well as other southern states, with multiple days of sustained below-freezing temperatures. At the peak of the outage, nearly 10 million people were without power. Additional impacts were frozen water pipes, which burst upon thawing causing water damage to buildings. These extreme conditions also caused or contributed to the deaths of more than 125 people in Texas alone, and this number is expected to increase further, after additional reporting. There were also snow and ice impacts across numerous states including Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, Colorado, Oregon and Washington. This is now the most costly U.S. winter storm event on record surpassing (nearly doubling the inflation-adjusted cost) of Superstorm 1993."
Storm,"Western Wildfires - California, Oregon, Washington Firestorms Fall 2020",8/1/2020,12/30/2020,46,23.2,"A record-breaking U.S. wildfire season burned more than 10.2 million acres. California more than doubled its previous annual record for area burned (last set in 2018) with over 4.1 million acres. Five of the top six largest wildfires on record in California (dating to 1932) burned during August and September. The August Complex was the largest California wildfire, which began as 37 separate wildfires within the Mendocino National Forest, set off after storms caused >10,000 lightning strikes across Northern California. Approximately 10,500 structures were damaged or destroyed across California. Oregon also had historic levels of wildfire damage, as over 2,000 structures burned. These wildfires spread rapidly and destroyed several small towns in California, Oregon and Washington. Colorado also had a severe wildfire season, as its three largest wildfires on record burned during 2020.
