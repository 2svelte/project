Disaster,Event,Begin Date,End Date,Deaths,CPI-Adjusted Estimated Cost (In Billions),Summary
Hurricane,Hurricane Zeta ,10/28/2020,10/29/2020,6,125,"Hurricane Zeta was a category 2 hurricane that made landfall at Cocodrie, Louisiana with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph on October 28th. Zeta's path inland saw an acceleration of its quick landfall speed to nearly 40 mph, which allowed the wind fields to maintain some strength. These wind impacts propagated well inland affecting parts of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, northern Georgia and into the Carolinas. Hurricane Zeta was the fifth tropical cyclone to make landfall in Louisiana during 2020 as part of a historically active Atlantic hurricane season."
Hurricane,Hurricane Delta ,10/9/2020,10/11/2020,5,125,"Hurricane Delta was a category 2 hurricane that made landfall near Creole, Louisiana with winds of 100 mph on October 9. This was nearly the same location in which category 4 Hurricane Laura made landfall 6 weeks prior. Heavy rainfall, high winds, storm surge, and nearly one dozen EF-0 or EF-1 tornadoes caused damage across several states including Louisiana, eastern Texas, Mississippi and Georgia."
Hurricane,Hurricane Sally ,9/15/2020,9/17/2020,5,90,"Hurricane Sally was a category 2 hurricane at landfall in Gulf Shores, Alabama. Wind gusts up to 100 mph and 20-30 inches of rainfall caused considerable flood and wind damage across Alabama, the Florida panhandle and into Georgia. Many homes and businesses in downtown Pensacola, FL were impacted from flooding produced by storm surge and heavy rainfall. 2020 is now the fourth consecutive year (2017-2020) that the U.S. has been impacted by a slow moving tropical cyclone that produced extreme rainfall and damaging floods - Harvey, Florence, Imelda and Sally."
Hurricane,Hurricane Laura ,8/27/2020,8/28/2020,42,77.4,"Hurricane Laura was a powerful category 4 that made landfall at Cameron Parish, in southwestern Louisiana on August 27. Winds up to 150 mph and storm surge in excess of 15 feet caused heavy damage along the coast and inland to the city of Lake Charles. Many broken water systems and a severely damaged electrical grid in southern Louisiana will slow the recovery process. Laura was the strongest hurricane (by maximum sustained windspeed at landfall) to hit Louisiana since the 1856 Last Island hurricane. Laura also had highest landfall wind speed to impact the U.S. since Hurricane Michael in 2018. There were additional impacts to surrounding states including Texas, Mississippi and Arkansas."
Hurricane,Hurricane Isaias ,8/3/2020,8/4/2020,16,50,"Hurricane Isaias made landfall in southeastern North Carolina as a category 1 storm. Isaias accelerated up the East Coast, resulting in widespread damage and power outages across New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. There was also considerable inland flooding most notably in Pennsylvania. In addition, 34 tornadoes developed across North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey due to Isaias. Many tornadoes were weaker (EF-0 and EF-1) producing scattered damage to agriculture, structures and residences. Isaias also produced several EF-2 tornadoes and one EF-3 tornado that caused damage in coastal North Carolina and Virginia."
Flood,Louisiana Flooding ,5/15/2021,5/19/2021,5,10.7,"Torrential rainfall from thunderstorms across coastal Texas and Louisiana caused widespread flooding and resulted in hundreds of water rescues. Baton Rouge and Lake Charles experienced flood damage to thousands of homes, vehicles and businesses, as more than 12 inches of rain fell. Lake Charles also continues to recover from the widespread damage caused by Hurricanes Laura and Delta less than 9 months before this flood event."
Flood,California Flooding ,1/24/2021,1/29/2021,2,10,"California was impacted by an atmospheric river in late-January, in which more than 7 inches of rain fell from southern California to the central California coast. Rainfall totals exceeded 15 inches in Monterey and San Luis Obispo counties. These heavy rains caused flooding and mudslides in some of the same areas burned by wildfires in late-2020. This combination caused dozens of slides and debris flows damaging homes, vehicles and businesses and infrastructure. Highway 1 south of Big Sur was washed out while the Sierra Nevada range received several feet of snow, closing major highways. In addition to significant rain and snow, high winds also caused extensive power outages across parts the region."
Flood,Mississippi River Flooding ,3/15/2019,7/31/2019,4,6.2,"Additional major flooding impacted many Southern Plains states significantly affecting agriculture, roads, bridges, levees, dams and other assets across many cities and towns. The states most affected were Oklahoma, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Kansas, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana. Very high water levels also disrupted barge traffic along the Mississippi River, which negatively impacted a variety of dependent industries. Indiana and Ohio were also affected by persistent heavy rainfall that flooded farmland, which prevented and reduced crop planting by millions of acres."
Flood,Arkansas River Flooding,5/20/2019,6/14/2019,5,6.2,"Historic flooding impacts the Arkansas River Basin with damage to homes, agriculture, roads, bridges and levees focused across eastern Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Thousands of homes, cars and businesses were flooded due a combination of high rivers, levee failure and persistently heavy rainfall from May 20 through June."
Storm,Texas Hail Storms,4/12/2021,4/15/2021,0,52.7,"A series of hail storms impacted central Texas causing damage to many homes, vehicles and businesses. There was considerable hail damage northeast of Austin, west of Georgetown and southwest of The Woodlands."
Storm,Northwest Winter Storm,2/10/2021,2/19/2021,172,24,"Historic cold wave and winter storm impacts many northwest, central and eastern states. Temperature departures exceeding 40.0 degrees F (22.2 degrees C) below normal occurred from Nebraska southward to Texas. The prolonged arctic air caused widespread power outages in Texas, as well as other southern states, with multiple days of sustained below-freezing temperatures. At the peak of the outage, nearly 10 million people were without power. Additional impacts were frozen water pipes, which burst upon thawing causing water damage to buildings. These extreme conditions also caused or contributed to the deaths of more than 125 people in Texas alone, and this number is expected to increase further, after additional reporting. There were also snow and ice impacts across numerous states including Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, Colorado, Oregon and Washington. This is now the most costly U.S. winter storm event on record surpassing (nearly doubling the inflation-adjusted cost) of Superstorm 1993."
Storm,Tropical Storm Eta ,11/8/2020,11/12/2020,12,20,"Tropical Storm Eta made landfall in the Florida Keys on November 8 followed by a second landfall near Cedar Key on the west coast of Florida on November 10. Eta produced wind and heavy rain impacts in southern Florida. These impacts continued well inland, as Eta's energy merged with a cold front across several eastern states. This combination produced extreme rainfall across North Carolina and Virginia, which led to significant flooding that damaged homes, businesses and infrastructure. This flooding also caused one dozen fatalities."
Storm,South Texas Hail Storms ,5/27/2020,5/27/2020,0,18,"South Texas hail storms cause widespread impact to several cities with golf-ball sized hail damaging many homes, vehicles and businesses. The highest concentration of hail damage occurred across the northern portion of the San Antonio metroplex. There was also significant damage east of San Marcos, southeast of Waco and to the west and south of Bryan and College Station."
Tornado,Southeast Tornadoes ,3/24/2021,3/25/2021,6,23.2,"At least 41 tornadoes impact several states including Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. These included one EF-4, four EF-3s, ten EF-2s and approximately two-dozen EF-1 or EF-0 tornadoes. The strongest of these tornadoes were focused across central Alabama and western Georgia with tracks across the entire width of Alabama. There was widespread damage to homes, businesses, vehicles and infrastructure."
Tornado,Southeast-Eastern Tornado,4/12/2020,4/13/2020,35,13.1,"Outbreak of at least 140 tornadoes from Texas to Maryland including 3 EF4s, 12 EF3s, 20 EF2s, 77 EF1s and 28 EF0s. Damage was extensive and highly destructive to many homes, vehicles and businesses across more than a dozen Southeast and Eastern states."
Tornado,Tennessee Tornadoes ,3/2/2020,3/4/2020,25,12.5,"Powerful EF-3 and EF-4 tornadoes cause considerable damage across the Nashville metroplex and several counties east of Nashville. This damage included many homes, businesses, vehicles, 90 planes and numerous buildings at the Nashville airport. There was also additional hail and wind damage in the surrounding states including Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi and Missouri."
Tornado,Southeast Tornadoes Jan,1/10/2020,1/12/2020,10,11.1,"More than 80 tornadoes and severe storms caused damage across many southeastern states (AL, AR, GA, IL, IN, KY, LA, MS, MO, NC, OH, SC, TN, TX, VA, WI). Storms and severe flooding also impacted northern states including Michigan, Wisconsin and New York. Significant damage occurred along the shoreline of Lake Michigan to roads, the foundation of homes and to Port Milwaukee. These powerful waves were generated by high winds and a lack of seasonal ice cover."
Tornado,Texas Tornadoes ,10/20/2019,10/20/2019,2,4.5,"Numerous tornadoes caused widespread damage across northern Dallas damaging thousands of homes, vehicles, businesses and other public infrastructure. Tornadoes up to EF-3 intensity with maximum winds of 140 mph tracked across a large section of highly developed northern Dallas. Additionally high winds and hail damage also caused damage in other states including Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee."
